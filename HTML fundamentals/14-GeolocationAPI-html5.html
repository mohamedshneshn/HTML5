What is the Geolocation API?
In HTML5, the Geolocation API is used to obtain the user's location.
Since this can compromise user privacy, the option is not available unless the user approves it.
Geolocation is much more accurate for devices with GPS, like smartphones and the like. -->

<!-- navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition();    in js
Parameters:
showLocation (mandatory): Defines the callback method that retrieves location information.
ErrorHandler(optional): Defines the callback method that is invoked when an error occurs in processing the asynchronous call.
Options (optional): Defines a set of options for retrieving the location information. -->

<!-- Presenting Data

User location can be presented in two ways: Geodetic and Civic.

1. The geodetic way to describe position refers directly to latitude and longitude.
2. The civic representation of location data is presented in a format that is more easily read and understood by the average person.

Each parameter has both a geodetic and a civic representation: -->

<!-- The getCurrentPosition() method returns an object if it is successful. The latitude, longitude, 
and accuracy properties are always returned. -->
