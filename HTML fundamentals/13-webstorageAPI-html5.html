    <!-- HTML5 Web Storage


With HTML5 web storage, websites can store data on a user's local computer.
Before HTML5, we had to use JavaScript "cookies" to achieve this functionality.

The Advantages of Web Storage
- More secure
- Faster
- Stores a larger amount of data
- Stored data is not sent with every server request
Local storage is per domain. All pages from one domain can store and access the same data. -->

<!-- There are two types of HTML5 web storage :
- sessionStorage()
- localStorage()

Local vs. Session
- Session Storage is destroyed once the user closes the browser
- Local Storage stores data with no expiration date -->

<!-- The syntax for web storage for both local and session storage is very simple and similar.
The data is stored as key/value pairs.

in JS:
Storing a Value:
localStorage.setItem("key1", "value1");
sessionStorage.setItem("key1", "value1");

 
Getting a Value:
//this will print the value
alert(localStorage.getItem("key1")); 

Removing a Value:
localStorage.removeItem("key1");

Removing All Values:
localStorage.clear(); -->
