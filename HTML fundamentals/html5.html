<!-- HTML5


When writing HTML5 documents, one of the first new features that you'll notice is the doc type declaration:
<!DOCTYPE HTML> 
HTML
The character encoding (charset) declaration is also simplified:
<meta charset="UTF-8">
HTML
New Elements in HTML5
<article>, <aside>, <audio>, <canvas>, <datalist>, <details>, <embed>, <footer>, <header>, <nav>, <output>, <progress>, <section>, <video>, and even more!

<!-- The List of Content Models


In HTML, elements typically belonged in either the block level or inline content model.
 HTML5 introduces seven main content models.

- Metadata
- Embedded
- Interactive
- Heading
- Phrasing
- Flow
- Sectioning
The HTML5 content models are designed 
to make the markup structure more meaningful for both the browser and the web designer. -->
<!-- -----------------------------------  -->

<!-- Content Models


Metadata: Content that sets up the presentation or behavior of the rest of the content. These elements are found in the head of the document.
Elements: <base>, <link>, <meta>, <noscript>, <script>, <style>, <title>

Embedded: Content that imports other resources into the document.
Elements: <audio>, <video>, <canvas>, <iframe>, <img>, <math>, <object>, <svg>

Interactive: Content specifically intended for user interaction.
Elements: <a>, <audio>, <video>, <button>, <details>, <embed>, <iframe>, <img>, <input>, <label>, <object>, <select>, <textarea>

Heading: Defines a section header.
Elements: <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>, <hgroup>

Phrasing: This model has a number of inline level elements in common with HTML4.
Elements: <img>, <span>, <strong>, <label>, <br />, <small>, <sub>, and more.
The same element can belong to more than one content model. -->

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------  -->

<!-- Flow content: Contains the majority of HTML5 elements that would be
 included in the normal flow of the document.

Sectioning content: Defines the scope of headings, content, navigation, and footers.
Elements: <article>, <aside>, <nav>, <section> -->

<!-- --------------------------  -->

<!-- A generic HTML5 page structure looks like this:
<header></header> # The header contains the logo and navigation
<nav></nav> # The navigation contains the main navigation
<article></article> # The main content
<section></section> # divide the main content into sections
<section></section> # divide the main content into sections
<aside></aside> # The aside contains the sidebar
<footer></footer> # The footer contains the copyright information -->
<!-- -------------------------------------  -->

<!-- In HTML4, we would define a header like this:
<div id="header">
HTML
In HTML5, a simple <header> tag is used, instead. -->

<!-- -------------------------------------  -->

<!-- The <footer> Element


    The footer element is also widely used. Generally we refer to a section located at the very bottom of the web page as the footer.
    <footer></footer>
    HTML
    The following information is usually provided between these tags:
    - Contact Information
    - Privacy Policy
    - Social Media Icons
    - Terms of Service
    - Copyright Information
    - Sitemap and Related Documents -->
<!-- -----------------------------------------------------  -->

    
<!-- The <nav> Element

This tag represents a section of a page that links to other pages or
 to certain sections within the page. 
This would be a section with navigation links. 

Not all of the links in a document should be inside a <nav> element.
     The <nav> element is intended only for major blocks of navigation links.
         Typically, the <footer> element often has a 
    list of links that don't need to be in a <nav> element
        .-->
<!-- -----------------------------------------------------  -->

<!-- <article></article> 
#used to contain the main content of the document
#replaces the <div> element that was widely used in HTML4, along with an id or class.
    <article>
        <h1>The article title</h1> 
        <p>Contents of the article element </p>
    </article> -->
<!-- -----------------------------------------------------  -->

<!-- <section> is a logical container of the page or article.
    Sections can be used to divide up content within an article.
    <article>
        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <section>
            <h1>Heading</h1>
            <p>content or image</p>
        </section>
    </article> -->
<!-- -----------------------------------  -->
<!-- <aside></aside> 

<aside> is a secondory content that is related to the main content of the page but if
used within an <article> tag, the content of the <aside> should be specifically related to that article.

    <article>
        <h1> Gifts for everyone</h1>
        <p>This website will be the best place for choosing gifts</p>
        <aside>
            <p>Gifts will be delivered to you within 24 hours</p>
        </aside>
    </article> -->
